# The Original Token Protocol

Before Ethereum. Before ERC-20. Before the ICO mania of 2017. There was Colored Coins.

The idea was elegant: use Bitcoin's existing transaction structure to represent any asset. Stocks, bonds, property deeds, concert tickets—anything. You "color" satoshis to represent ownership, and the Bitcoin blockchain handles the rest.

The [protocol specification](https://github.com/Colored-Coins/Colored-Coins-Protocol-Specification) is still sitting on GitHub. 143 stars. Last meaningful update years ago. A relic from an alternate timeline where we built tokens on Bitcoin instead of creating a thousand new blockchains.

I decided to see if it still works.

## The Experiment

I pulled down the spec, set up a modern Bitcoin Core node, and started implementing. My expectation? Days of debugging. Outdated dependencies. Broken opcodes. The usual archaeology project.

What actually happened?

```typescript
// Colored Coins: still works on Bitcoin Core 2026
const coloredOutput = {
  script: bitcoin.script.compile([
    bitcoin.opcodes.OP_RETURN,
    encodeColoredCoinMetadata({
      assetId: generateAssetId(issuingAddress),
      amount: 1000,
      divisibility: 0,
      metadata: { name: 'TestToken', symbol: 'TST' }
    })
  ]),
  value: 0
};
```

It just... worked.

The blockchain skills I've built up—the same ones I use for [OP_RETURN experiments](/blog/bitcoin-opreturn-to-lightning-journey) and [Lightning development](/blog/lightning-encrypted-message-queue)—handled it with almost no modification. The protocol is simple. Bitcoin's scripting is stable. The fundamentals haven't changed.

In an afternoon, I had tokens minting on testnet.

## The Uncomfortable Question

So here I am, with working Colored Coins on modern Bitcoin Core, asking myself: if this is so easy, why is nobody doing it?

The obvious answer is cost.

A Colored Coins transaction on mainnet during high-fee periods? 15,000+ sats. At current prices, that's real money for what Ethereum does for a few dollars (and Solana does for fractions of a cent). The economics don't make sense for high-frequency token transfers.

But that's not the whole story.

## The Lightning Escape Hatch

Everyone who's tried to build on Layer 1 Bitcoin eventually has the same realization: fees make it impractical for most use cases. The solution? Move to Layer 2.

Lightning Network is flexible, fast, and cheap. Want to build a token system? RGB Protocol is doing exactly that—Colored Coins concepts on Lightning. Better economics. Same security (eventually settled to Bitcoin).

```typescript
// The Layer 2 answer
// RGB: Colored Coins concepts, Lightning economics
const rgbAsset = await issueAsset({
  ticker: 'TST',
  name: 'TestToken',
  supply: 1000000,
  // Settles to Bitcoin, operates on Lightning
});
```

So the smart money moved to L2. Layer 1 became a settlement layer for high-value, low-frequency transactions. The token experiments moved elsewhere.

But something bothers me about this.

## The Case for Layer 1

Lightning is great. I'm building on it. But there's something different about a token that exists directly on Bitcoin's base layer.

- **No channel management.** The asset exists. Period.
- **No liquidity requirements.** You own it or you don't.
- **Maximum decentralization.** Every Bitcoin node validates your token.
- **True permanence.** No Lightning node going offline, no channel closures.

For certain use cases—property deeds, stock certificates, high-value collectibles—the extra cost might be worth it. You're paying for the most secure, censorship-resistant ledger in existence.

## Should It Be Me?

I keep coming back to this question.

The Colored Coins spec works. The tools exist. The blockchain hasn't rejected it. Someone could build a modern token platform on Bitcoin Layer 1, focused on use cases where the security premium is worth the cost.

Real estate tokenization. Fine art provenance. Corporate stock certificates. Things where you'd gladly pay $20 per transaction for the guarantee of Bitcoin-level security.

Is anyone building this? Not really. Most Bitcoin developers are focused on Lightning. Most token developers are on Ethereum or Solana. The intersection—tokens on Bitcoin L1—is a ghost town.

```typescript
// The opportunity (or the trap?)
const realEstateToken = await createColoredCoin({
  assetId: 'property-deed-123-main-st',
  metadata: {
    propertyAddress: '123 Main Street',
    legalDescription: '...',
    recordedWith: 'County Assessor'
  },
  // Worth $20 in fees? For a property deed? Maybe.
});
```

I've been in Bitcoin since 2013. I run Chainbytes. I have the skills. I have the infrastructure.

But do I have the conviction to build something that everyone else has abandoned?

## The Real Question

Maybe the market has spoken. Maybe Layer 1 tokens are a solved problem that nobody wants to solve again. Maybe Lightning and RGB are the right answer, and Colored Coins belongs in a museum.

Or maybe everyone's been so focused on Layer 2 that they forgot Layer 1 is still there, still stable, still the most secure ledger on the planet.

I'm not sure yet. But I got the protocol working. The code is sitting on my machine. The testnet tokens exist.

Someone should be building this. The question is whether that someone is me.
