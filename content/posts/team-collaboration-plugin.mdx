## The Monday Morning That Broke Me

9:47 AM. I'm scrolling through Slack, trying to piece together what happened over the weekend. Three threads about the same bug. A GitHub issue that got closed but the fix never merged. Someone started working on a feature I'd already finished on Friday. And our standup doc? Empty. Again.

This wasn't a bad team. We were good engineers. But our coordination was held together with Slack threads, sporadic GitHub notifications, and the vague hope that everyone was on the same page.

Spoiler: we were never on the same page.

I'd tried everything. Daily standups that nobody updated. Notion boards that became graveyards. Project management tools that added process without adding clarity. Each solution created more overhead, more context-switching, more "let me check the thing" moments that fragmented our actual work.

What I needed wasn't another tool to maintain. I needed something that could watch what we were doing and keep everyone informed automatically. Something that understood our workflows and surfaced the right information at the right time.

That's when I built the team-collaboration plugin.

## What Team Collaboration Actually Solves

The plugin tackles the four coordination problems that were eating my team alive:

### 1. Issue Tracking Integration

Issues live in GitHub. Context lives in our heads. The two rarely meet.

The team-collaboration plugin bridges this gap by understanding your issue tracking workflow:

```bash
/team-sync issues

Scanning GitHub issues for project: auth-service

Active Issues:
- #142: Token refresh race condition (assigned: @maria, blocked by #138)
- #138: Redis connection pooling (assigned: @devon, in review)
- #145: Add rate limiting to /login (unassigned, priority: high)

Context from recent commits:
- Devon's pooling fix addresses the root cause of #142
- Maria can unblock once #138 merges
- #145 relates to security audit findings from last week

Suggested actions:
1. Review Devon's PR to unblock Maria
2. Assign #145 before it becomes urgent
```

The plugin doesn't just list issues - it understands relationships. It sees that one person is blocked, traces why, and suggests the action that unblocks the team.

### 2. Standup Automation

I stopped fighting the "nobody updates the standup doc" battle. Instead, the plugin generates standups from what actually happened:

```bash
/standup generate

Team Standup - Monday, October 7th

Devon:
- Completed: Redis connection pooling refactor (#138)
- In Progress: Code review feedback, 2 comments addressed
- Blockers: None

Maria:
- Completed: Token refresh tests added
- In Progress: Race condition fix (#142), waiting on #138
- Blockers: Dependent on Devon's PR

Eric:
- Completed: Rate limiting spike, documented approach
- In Progress: Implementation for /login endpoint
- Blockers: Need security team sign-off on approach

Team Health:
- 1 blocking dependency (Devon -> Maria)
- 2 PRs awaiting review
- No stale issues (oldest active: 3 days)
```

This gets generated from commit history, PR activity, and issue updates. No one had to write anything. No one had to remember to update a document. The work itself became the documentation.

### 3. Team Communication Tools

The plugin provides intelligent notifications that actually matter:

```bash
/team-notify blocking

Checking for blocking dependencies...

Alert: Maria's work on #142 is blocked
- Blocker: #138 (Devon's PR) needs review
- Time blocked: 6 hours
- Impact: Auth service security fix delayed

Notification sent to:
- Devon: "Your PR #138 is blocking Maria - review requested"
- Team lead: "Blocking dependency detected in auth-service"
```

No more "hey, did you see my message?" No more waiting hours because someone didn't notice a PR was ready. The plugin watches for blocking states and proactively surfaces them to the people who can resolve them.

It also handles the async communication patterns that distributed teams need:

```bash
/team-handoff @maria

Creating handoff summary for @maria...

Context package:
- Current branch state: feature/rate-limiting, 3 commits ahead of main
- Open questions: Redis vs. in-memory for rate limit counters
- Related issues: #145, #89 (closed, has relevant discussion)
- Key files: src/middleware/rateLimit.ts, tests/rateLimit.test.ts
- Environment notes: Staging has new Redis instance, connection string in Vault

Handoff sent. Maria will have full context when she picks this up.
```

Timezone handoffs used to mean an hour of Slack archaeology. Now they take seconds.

### 4. Project Coordination

For larger initiatives spanning multiple people and weeks, the plugin maintains a living project state:

```bash
/project-status auth-overhaul

Project: Authentication System Overhaul
Timeline: Week 3 of 4

Workstreams:
1. Token Management (Maria): 80% complete
   - Refresh logic: Done
   - Race conditions: In progress
   - Migration script: Not started

2. Rate Limiting (Eric): 40% complete
   - Spike: Done
   - Implementation: In progress
   - Load testing: Not started

3. Infrastructure (Devon): 90% complete
   - Redis pooling: In review
   - Connection monitoring: Done
   - Failover handling: Done

Dependencies:
- Maria blocked on Devon (resolving today)
- Load testing needs staging environment (ETA: Wednesday)

Risk assessment:
- On track for Friday completion if Devon's PR merges today
- Load testing is the critical path for the remaining timeline
```

This isn't a Gantt chart. It's a real-time synthesis of what's actually happening across the team, derived from our actual work artifacts.

## The Workflow That Finally Stuck

After months of iteration, here's how my team actually uses this:

**Morning**: Run `/standup generate`. Skim it in two minutes. Know what everyone's working on without a 30-minute meeting.

**Throughout the day**: Let `/team-notify blocking` run in the background. When someone gets stuck, the right people know immediately.

**Handoffs**: Use `/team-handoff` whenever work moves between people. No more "let me get you up to speed" conversations that take longer than the actual work.

**Weekly**: Run `/project-status` to see where we actually are, not where we hoped we'd be.

The key insight: we stopped trying to make people do coordination work. We let the plugin derive coordination information from the work we were already doing.

## The Integration Layer

The team-collaboration plugin sits between your existing tools:

- **GitHub**: Issues, PRs, commits, code owners
- **Git**: Branch state, commit history, merge status
- **Project context**: The accumulated understanding from your sessions

It doesn't replace your tools. It reads them. It synthesizes them. It turns the noise of daily activity into signal.

```yaml
# Example integration configuration
integrations:
  github:
    repo: "org/auth-service"
    sync: ["issues", "pull_requests", "commits"]
  notifications:
    blocking: immediate
    daily_summary: "09:00"
  standup:
    generate_from: ["commits", "issues", "prs"]
    include_blockers: true
```

This is the configuration that finally killed our manual standup document. It didn't ask anyone to do extra work. It just watched what we were already doing and told us what we needed to know.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

Team coordination isn't a tooling problem. It's an information flow problem.

Information gets generated constantly - commits, comments, issues opened, PRs merged. But that information is scattered. It's in GitHub notifications that get buried. It's in Slack threads that get lost. It's in someone's head because they forgot to write it down.

The team-collaboration plugin doesn't create new information. It aggregates and routes existing information. It makes sure the person who needs to know something actually knows it, without requiring someone else to manually relay it.

This is the difference between a team that's busy and a team that's coordinated. Both teams are doing work. One team knows what everyone else is doing. The other team is surprised by merge conflicts, duplicated effort, and missed handoffs.

I've been running this with teams at [chainbytes.com](https://chainbytes.com), and the results aren't subtle. Fewer "I didn't know you were working on that" conversations. Fewer blocking dependencies that sit for hours. Fewer Monday morning archaeology sessions trying to reconstruct what happened last week.

## Getting Started

The team-collaboration plugin is part of the [agents-skills-plugins](https://github.com/EricGrill/agents-skills-plugins) collection. It works best when combined with other plugins in the ecosystem - context management for preserving project state, agent orchestration for complex multi-person workflows.

Start with `/standup generate`. See what it surfaces. You might be surprised by what your team is actually doing versus what you thought they were doing.

Then add `/team-notify blocking` and watch how quickly blocking dependencies get resolved when the right people actually know about them.

The goal isn't perfect coordination. Perfect coordination doesn't exist. The goal is to stop spending human attention on information routing that software can handle automatically.

---

Three months ago, my team coordination strategy was "hope everyone reads Slack." Now I have a system that watches our work and tells us what we need to know. Not everything. Not noise. Just the information that matters, routed to the people who can act on it.

The standup doc is still empty. But now that's fine. The plugin generates what we need. And somehow, that's better than anything we ever wrote ourselves.

*"The best teams don't coordinate harder. They coordinate smarter - letting systems handle information flow so humans can focus on decisions."*
