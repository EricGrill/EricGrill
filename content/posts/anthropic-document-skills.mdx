Claude Code includes a powerful set of document processing skills that enable creating and manipulating common office file formats directly from natural language instructions. These skills transform Claude from a code assistant into a comprehensive document automation tool.

## What Are Document Skills?

Document skills are specialized capabilities that extend Claude Code's functionality beyond code editing. They provide structured workflows for generating professional documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and PDFs—all through conversational commands.

Each skill is invoked using a slash command (like `/pdf` or `/docx`) and guides Claude through the document creation process with appropriate prompts and best practices.

## Available Document Skills

### 2. pdf - PDF Generation

**Skill:** [pdf](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/pdf)

The `pdf` skill handles PDF creation and manipulation. PDFs are essential for documents that need to maintain exact formatting across different systems.

This skill excels at quickly generating presentation decks for meetings, pitches, training materials, and educational content.

### 4. xlsx - Excel Spreadsheets

**Skill:** [xlsx](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/xlsx)

The `xlsx` skill creates and manipulates Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, including formulas, formatting, and data organization.

**Usage:**

```

**Capabilities:**
- Create spreadsheets with multiple worksheets
- Add and format data in cells
- Include formulas and calculations

Use this skill for financial documents, data analysis templates, inventory tracking, and any tabular data that benefits from spreadsheet functionality.

### 5. doc-coauthoring - Collaborative Document Editing

**Skill:** [doc-coauthoring](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/doc-coauthoring)

The `doc-coauthoring` skill provides an interactive workflow for editing documents collaboratively with Claude. Rather than generating a complete document at once, it enables iterative refinement.

**Usage:**
```
/doc-coauthoring Help me revise my research paper draft
```

**Capabilities:**
- Review and suggest edits to existing documents
- Make targeted improvements to specific sections
- Preserve document structure while enhancing content
- Provide explanations for suggested changes
- Iterate through multiple revision rounds

This skill is particularly valuable when you have an existing document that needs refinement rather than starting from scratch.

## Getting Started

To use these skills, ensure you have Claude Code installed and the skills enabled. Each skill can be invoked directly:

```bash
# In Claude Code, simply use the slash command
/pdf Create a certificate of completion for "Introduction to AI" course

/xlsx Build a project timeline with tasks, owners, and due dates
```

## Practical Applications

These document skills open up numerous automation possibilities:

- **Report Generation:** Automatically create weekly or monthly reports from data
- **Template Population:** Fill document templates with dynamic content
- **Batch Processing:** Generate multiple documents with variations
- **Format Conversion:** Create documents in specific formats as needed
- **Documentation:** Produce user manuals, guides, and technical documentation
