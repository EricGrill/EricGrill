# Bitcoin in 2025

After being in the Bitcoin space since 2013, I've seen countless cycles, FUD storms, and "the end of Bitcoin" predictions. Yet here we are, stronger than ever.

## What's Changed

The infrastructure has matured dramatically:

- Lightning Network adoption has exploded
- Institutional custody solutions are now enterprise-grade
- Regulatory clarity (while not perfect) has improved

## What I'm Building

At Chainbytes, we're focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and Bitcoin. Our ATM network continues to expand, and we're working on some exciting new features that I can't talk about yet.

```typescript
// The beauty of Bitcoin development
const createTransaction = async (recipient: string, amount: number) => {
  const utxos = await getUnspentOutputs();
  const tx = buildTransaction(utxos, recipient, amount);
  return signAndBroadcast(tx);
};
```

## Looking Forward

The next few years will be crucial. We're at an inflection point where Bitcoin either becomes the global reserve asset or remains a speculative instrument. I know which side I'm betting on.

The fundamentals haven't changed. The technology is solid. The network is secure. The future is bright.

Stay humble. Stack sats.
