# The Operating System

I've spent my life inside systems under pressure.

In the Navy, I learned that complex systems fail in predictable ways—and that the people who survive are the ones who understand failure before it arrives. You don't rise to the occasion. You fall to the level of your training.

In software, I spent decades building systems where mistakes cost real money. Trading floors. Financial infrastructure. High-security environments where a single bug could cascade into catastrophe. You learn to think in terms of attack surfaces, failure modes, and redundancy.

In Bitcoin, I found the first money that doesn't require permission. I've been here since 2013, long enough to watch entire narratives rise and collapse, to see the tourists leave and the builders stay. Today I run Chainbytes, where we build Bitcoin ATM infrastructure that moves real value through real machines in the real world.

On the mats, I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and compete at the highest levels. IBJJF Europeans gold medalist. The mats teach you what code and combat have in common: position before submission, pressure reveals truth, and ego is the enemy of progress.

What connects all of this is simple: **systems under stress reveal what actually works.**

Theories collapse. Credentials mean nothing. What survives is what was built correctly from the start.

This site is my lab.

I document experiments in code, security, automation, and performance. Not tutorials—field notes from someone building at the edge. I share what I'm learning because ideas that stay private rot, and knowledge compounds when it moves.

**The mission is decentralization.**

Remove power structures. Build technology that replaces the need for centralized control. Create systems that keep working when institutions fail.

This is not ideology. It's engineering. Centralized systems are single points of failure. Distributed systems survive.

If you're building something that matters—in code, in competition, in life—you're in the right place.

I don't have all the answers. But I'm in the arena, not the stands.

Welcome to the lab.
