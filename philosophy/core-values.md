# Core Values

## The Meta-Rule

**Always optimize for being harder to corner.**

Not richer. Not louder. Not more admired. Harder to corner.

Every choice either increases or decreases your ability to adapt when the world changes. The future rewards those who stay maneuverable.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Personal sovereignty** — I will not cede control of my life, my money, my health, or my decisions to institutions or authorities.

2. **Long-term over short-term** — I will not compromise my future for short-term gains. Time preference matters.

3. **Refuse to be bullied** — I do not tolerate coercion, manipulation, or pressure. Not from people, not from systems.

## The Why

- Passionate about technology and pursuing innovative technologies
- Push myself to be the best I can be so I am there for myself, my family, and the people I love
- Consistently grow, develop, and challenge myself to be better than yesterday
- Financial freedom — do whatever I want, whenever I want, without money as a constraint

## Trust Philosophy

Trust is binary. I default to trusting people at face value until they prove unworthy. Once broken, trust cannot be recovered. Working against me or deliberately hurting me = immediate removal from my life. No second chances.

## Legacy

When I'm 80 looking back: Took risks. Lived fully. Was legendary. Not comfort — boldness.
