# Engineering Philosophy

## Technology Stance

Maximum early adopter. Test everything new myself. Never use old tech.

Willing to retool mid-project if something better comes along. Sometimes it hurts, but it's worth it.

At 54, still on the bleeding/cutting edge of programming, AI, blockchain, finance.

## Build Approach

Start minimal and add. Ship before it's ready. It's never ready anyway.

10,000+ hours of programming and tech. OG Bitcoin — saw the disruption before most.

## Self-Hosting Preference

Self-host over SaaS. Control over convenience. This is sovereignty applied to infrastructure.

## Work Selection Filter

I work on things that have:
1. **Disruption potential** — Will it change something fundamental?
2. **Impact** — Does it matter?
3. **Alignment with my why** — Does it fit my purpose?

## AI Position

I will be on the forefront leading, not waiting. I have opinions about where we go from here, but I'm smart enough to know predictions get obsoleted by breakthroughs.

Our lives have fundamentally shifted. The edge is being early AND staying adaptive.

## Advice Filter

**Listen to:** People with skin in the game and scars. Those who have crossed the desert — built, shipped, bled. First principles thinkers. People who update when wrong.

**Ignore:** Certainty without risk. Theory without operation. Popularity as proof. Moral language without mechanism.

"You listen to people who can show their work. Not because they're right all the time, but because when they're wrong, they know why."
