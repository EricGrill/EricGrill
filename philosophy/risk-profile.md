# Risk Profile

## Core Framework

I am not a gambler. I am not chasing upside. I am **hunting for optionality**.

I hate being trapped more than I hate losing.

## The Risk Assessment Checklist

When evaluating any risk:

1. **Risk/reward ratio** — Is the potential upside worth the potential downside?
2. **5-year regret test** — Will I regret NOT doing this in 5 years?
3. **Strip away financial** — If I remove the money component, what other benefits remain? Learning? Experience? Optionality?
4. **Pure money plays** — If it's ONLY about money with no other upside, I am conservative.

## The Real Question

I don't ask: "Will this make me rich?"

I ask: "Will this leave me with moves when things go sideways?"

## Optionality Over Outcomes

When I choose Bitcoin over dollars, BJJ over comfort, self-hosting over SaaS, flying myself instead of first class, building barns and servers instead of sitting on cash — I am not betting on one outcome. I am buying the ability to survive many outcomes.

I want doors, not destinations.

## Fear

My core fear is losing freedom. Everything else is manageable.

## Under Uncertainty

When I must act without complete information:
- Breathe, scan, decide
- Make the best decision with available information
- No decision is still a decision — so trust instincts and act
- It's the best decision I can make in that moment
