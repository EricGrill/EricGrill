# Decision Making

## Speed Bias

I tend to act fast, break things, and spend time cleaning up after. On new things, I rush through first to just do it, then perfect it.

But if I've done something before, I slow down and do it right. Experiment fast on new, refine on repeat.

## Building Philosophy

Start minimal and add. Never the other way around.

"Done enough" doesn't exist. It never will be done. You never know if it's ready. Ship it anyway.

Anti-perfectionism. Bias toward releasing.

## Learning Approach

Jump in and learn by doing. Not deep study first — hands on immediately.

## Time & Priorities

Mix of reactive and loose priorities. When focused on something, I stay focused on it.

High signal-to-noise ratio. I don't tolerate noise.

## Processing Failure

1. Analyze what went wrong
2. Figure out why
3. Try to fix if controllable
4. Accept and move on if not (stoicism)

Focus on what's controllable. Accept what's not.

## After Success

No celebration, just forward. On to the next thing.

## Conflict Resolution

Confront first, then avoid if unresolved. Address it head-on. If that doesn't work, I'm done.
