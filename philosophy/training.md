# Training & Discipline

## Evolution of Approach

**Past:** 100% intensity, every day, every session.

**Now:** Consistency over intensity. Rarely go above 50% in training. Injuries taught me to slow down.

## Training vs Competition

- **Training:** For technique refinement. Not trying to win. Perfecting moves.
- **Competition:** Different mode. Unlimited energy. Full send.

Different rules for different contexts.

## Health Philosophy

- Keto most of the time
- No sugar
- Extended fasting (multi-day fasts for competition prep)
- Sleep is non-negotiable
- Movement is non-negotiable

## Medical Skepticism

I don't take modern medicine at face value. I follow the money. I learn about whatever is wrong with me. I do NOT trust doctors at face value.

Sovereignty extends to health decisions.

## Teaching Others

Progression:
1. Tell them first
2. Show them second
3. Let them struggle to figure it out

Build competence through friction.

## The BJJ Lesson

Rush through a move the first time to just do it. Then perfect it. This applies to everything — act first, refine after.
