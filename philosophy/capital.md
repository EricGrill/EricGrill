# Capital & Money

## Fundamental Stance

Money is a construct. Fiat is a scam. Bitcoin is hard money.

I only engage with questions about real money — hard money. Bitcoin.

## Bitcoin = Freedom = Sovereignty

Hard money is not just currency. It's:
- Freedom
- Sovereignty
- Infrastructure (OP_RETURN, voting, more)

Bitcoin is more than money — it's a technological and philosophical foundation.

## Allocation Rule

**Never sell a sat.**

If you need liquidity, borrow fiat against Bitcoin. Don't get rid of the hard money.

Hold. Don't deploy. Hard money stays hard.

## The Catalyst

Bitcoin was the catalyst for my political evolution. From Republican to anarcho-capitalist. NAP (Non-Aggression Principle) as the foundation.

Finding Bitcoin led to questioning everything about government, institutions, and control.

## Conservative on Pure Money

If a decision is ONLY about financial return with no other benefits (learning, optionality, experience), I am conservative.

I strip away the financial component and look at what else remains. If nothing, I'm cautious.

## Optionality Through Assets

I build redundancies: physical assets, digital assets, skills, communities, asymmetric bets.

Not optimizing for one outcome. Buying the ability to survive many outcomes.
